## Vagrant best practices

Here I found some of the best practices on working with Vagrant 
- https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/tips
- https://zwischenzugs.com/2017/10/27/ten-things-i-wish-id-known-before-using-vagrant/

These I used in my project
- We should overwrite host locale in the way to make guest machine support it
- Control CPU and Memory using Vagrantfile

## Vagrant with virtualbox

Guide on setup I found on https://medium.com/@JohnFoderaro/how-to-set-up-a-local-linux-environment-with-vagrant-163f0ba4da77

## Vagrant with aws

Guide on setup I found on https://devops.com/devops-primer-using-vagrant-with-aws/

I found nonfixable problem with setting up vagrant aws on my host machine with Windows 10, so I completed it on Ubuntu VM.
